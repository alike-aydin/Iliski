1) The files should be exclusively composed of numerical values.

2) Default format is a two-column text file. The first one should be the time vector, while the second one should be the data vector.

3) If there are more than 2 columns, only the first two will be accounted for and a warning displayed.

4) If there is only one column, it will be used as data. A vector with a timestep of 1 second will be used as time vector. In that case, beware of having a similar sampling time between your From and To data.
